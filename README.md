<h1> Playing with Git</h1>

<h2> Purpose</h2>

<p> To get used to the main git commands in conjunction with GitHub, and pushing/pulling content between GitHub and my local repos. There's really not much to see in terms of other file content. The main thing here is the explanation in this ReadMe of how I produced the simple text manipulation.

<h2> Getting set up locally</h2>

<p><i>Note: I use Linux (Ubuntu)</i></p>

<ul>
    <li><i>Make sure git is installed on system.</i> This can be checked with <code>$ git --version</code> </li>
    <li>Two</li>
    <li>Three</li>
</ul>


<h2> Aide Memoire</h2>

<p> Here are the main commands that I used once set up.:

<ul>
    <li>One</li>
    <li>Two</li>
    <li>Three</li>
</ul>
